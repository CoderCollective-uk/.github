We are the Coder Collective!

A collection of like-minded technology enthusiasts that is open to people of all (and no)
experience levels. We believe programming is most productive and fun when done collectively.

Our mission is to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for people to learn and
collaborate on projects. We aim to provide a space for people to learn and grow, and to
provide a platform for people to share their knowledge and experience with others.

While we have our origins in web development via FreeCodeCamp we encourage anyone with 
an ongoing project, or even just curiosity about computers, to come see what others are 
working on. Later if you feel you can contribute, you can.
